# Please, if you want to use the body_pose_estimator with a ROS callback use the camera_topic param, otherwise put it as "". 
# In this way, it will use the webcam!

# Example: Running on a video
# put as "" all *_topic and image_dir parameters,
# video must be the path to the video i.e. "video.mp4"

# Example: Running on images on dir
# put as "" all *_topic and video parameters
# image_dir must be the path to the images (it will look for the images recursively!)

# Example: Running on a webcam (specify which one with the camera_index parameter)
# put as "" all *_topic, image_dir and video parameters

# For all the examples check the resolution parameter (image to acquire),
# net_resolution (resolution of the CNN) and
# the camera_resolution (should be the same as resolution)
